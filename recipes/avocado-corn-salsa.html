        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Amazing corn salsa that’s loaded with bold flavors! Sweet corn, crunchy jalapeños and onion, 
            buttery avocado and tangy lime juice… this salsa is perfect with a big bowl of chips, or 
            loaded up onto tacos, burritos and more!

            I don’t know about you, but Tex-Mex style foods are some of my absolute favorites. Taco night is just about a weekly occurrence here for dinner, and whenever we go out to a local Mexican restaurant, I’ve discovered that I have zero self control when it comes to chips and salsa.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups corn kernels</li>
            <li>2 fresh jalapeños</li>
            <li>1/3 cup red onion</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1/4 cup lime juice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over HIGH or MED HIGH heat until very hot. Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and add corn kernels in an even layer. Cook 3-5 minutes, stirring often, until corn is charred, but not burnt.</li>
            <li>Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine cooled corn with jalapeños, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, sugar, salt, pepper, and avocado. Stir.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, or add a layer of plastic wrap directly on top of the salsa in the mixing bowl, then cover the entire bowl tightly and refrigerate before serving.</li>
        </ol>
