        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Macaroni and cheese—also called mac and cheese in the United States and macaroni cheese 
            in the United Kingdom[1]—is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most 
            commonly cheddar. It can also incorporate other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs or 
            meat.

            Traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared 
            in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. The cheese is often first 
            incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta. 
            In the United States, it is considered a comfort food.
